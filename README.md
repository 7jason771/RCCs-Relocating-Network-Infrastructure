Project name: RCCs-Relocating-Network-Infrastructure


# Ultimate Project Overview
I collaborated with a dedicated team to execute a complex and pivotal project: the complete relocation of our school's lab network to a new building. 
This undertaking required careful planning, coordination, and execution to ensure minimal disruption and optimal performance in the new location.

# Planning and Documentation
We began with an extensive planning phase that spanned approximately 5-6 months. During this time, we thoroughly documented every aspect of the existing network configuration. This included:

# Inventory of Network Devices: 
We cataloged every physical network device, including routers, switches, UPS units, and firewalls.
Configuration Records: Detailed records of each device's configuration were maintained to ensure a seamless setup in the new location.
Network Topology Mapping: We created comprehensive network topology diagrams to guide the reinstallation process and troubleshoot any issues efficiently.

# Physical Relocation
The actual relocation process involved several critical steps:

# De-Racking Equipment: 
We carefully de-racked all networking equipment from the existing lab. This required precision to avoid damaging sensitive components.
Secure Transportation: The equipment was securely transported to the new building, ensuring that all devices were protected from potential transit damage.
Re-Racking in New Location: Once at the new building, we re-racked all the networking equipment. This phase demanded careful attention to detail to ensure that all devices were properly installed and connected.

# Bringing Up the Network
After physically relocating the equipment, our focus shifted to bringing up the entire school lab network in the new environment. Key activities included:

# Cabling Configuration: 
We carefully restructured the network cabling infrastructure based on detailed plans to optimize performance and reliability across the school's new environment.

# Issue Resolution: 
Addressing any challenges encountered during the cabling setup process, we ensured a smooth transition for the school's network relocation project.

# Documentation and Review
Throughout the project, we maintained detailed documentation of every step. This included:

# Installation Procedures
Each step of the re-racking and configuration process was documented to provide a clear record of actions taken.
Issue Logs: Any challenges or issues encountered were logged along with the solutions implemented.

# Day 1:
- Installed 4 APC UPS to the 2 new server racks, 2 UPS's for 1 rack.

# Day 2:
- Moved and installed 9 lenovo and dell servers to the new server racks.
- Installed and cabled 27 mac minis to a new rack.
- Installed 1 KVM switch on top of one of the racks with several servers installed.

# Day 3: 
- Installed 9 cisco switches to a new rack.
- Installed 9 ISR (routers).
- Installed 1 APC UPS & 2 control switches

# Day 4:
- Performed cable management on the servers, routers, switches based on the labels & documentation we had.
- Cables included ISR's 1-6, serial cables, ethernet cables, ASYN-ACAV Octil cables.


Final Network Diagrams: Updated network topology diagrams reflecting the new setup were created and reviewed.

# Conclusion
The network relocation project was a one-time, well-planned initiative that required significant preparation and coordination. 
The careful planning and detailed documentation were critical to its success, ensuring that the transition to the new building was smooth and efficient. 
Our teamâ€™s dedication and systematic approach enabled us to relocate the entire school lab network with minimal downtime, maintaining the integrity and performance of our network infrastructure.
